Here is a revised version of the script. The stakes have been raised from Robbery to Murder. The logic remains similar (Time of Death / Alibi / The Grease), but the context is now a homicide investigation.
SCENE 1: THE DEFENSE LOBBY
[Player]: Ok! I got this! First trial is always the easiest? Right?
[Player]: Even if it is... a murder trial.
???: (Clicking her pen)
[Player]: Ahh!
???: You need to Chill out!
Clara Case appears
Clara Case:
You aren't facing anyone too hard. You're facing Percy Petty. They call him the "Rookie Crusher."
[Player]:
"R-R-Rookie Crusher"? That sounds terrifying. especially with a life on the line.
Clara Case: (Laughs)
Don't worry. He calls himself that. He’s been a prosecutor for ten years, but he only takes cases against newbies like you to boost his ego. He’s totally beatable if you keep your cool. Just remember: The victim, Mr. Billions, was found in the vault. Your client is the only suspect.

SCENE 2: THE COURTROOM
Judge Gavel:
Order! The court is now in session for the trial of Robbie Banks. The charge is Murder in the First Degree.
[Player]:
The Defense is ready, Your Honor!
Judge Gavel:
And the Prosecution?
Percy Petty: (Smirking, polishing his glasses)
The Prosecution has been ready since before this rookie passed the bar exam, Your Honor. I assume this will be quick? I have a hair appointment at 3:00.
Judge Gavel:
This is a murder trial, Mr. Petty. Treat it with respect. Your opening statement?
Percy Petty: (Chuckles condescendingly)
It is quite simple, really. The defendant, Mr. Banks, was found inside the vault standing over the body of the Bank Manager, Mr. Billions. The victim was struck by a heavy object. It is an open-and-shut case. I recommend the Defense plead guilty now and save us all the embarrassment.
[Player]: (Thinking)
He's treating a murder like a parking ticket. I can’t wait to wipe that smirk off his face.

SCENE 3: THE WITNESS
Percy Petty:
The Prosecution calls the brave Bank Security Guard, Sgt. Otto Lock!
(Sgt. Otto Lock rolls onto the witness stand, stands up, and salutes stiffly)
Otto Lock:
Security Officer Lock reporting for duty! Sector 4 is secured! The target has been neutralized—er, I mean, the victim was found! Over!
Judge Gavel:
Mr. Lock... please lower your hand.
Otto Lock:
Negative, Your Honor! Constant vigilance is the key to survival!
Percy Petty: (Smug)
As you can see, a dedicated professional. Sergeant, tell the court what you saw regarding the murder.
Otto Lock:
[TESTIMONY START] “Target Down”
"I was stationed at the Gold Zone (the vault). At 1300 hours (1:00 PM), I took a tactical hydration break."
"Suddenly, the perimeter was breached! I heard a scuffle!"
"I looked in and saw the hostile (Robbie) standing over the KIA (Killed in Action) holding the murder weapon!"
"I engaged and apprehended the suspect immediately!"
Percy Petty:
We have cold, hard facts. Your Honor, I present the decisive evidence.
[EVIDENCE PRESENTED: AUTOPSY REPORT]
(Time of death: Between 12:45 PM and 1:15 PM. Cause: Blunt force trauma).
Percy Petty:
The victim died right around 1:00 PM. Exactly when the witness saw the defendant.
Statement 1: "I was stationed at the Gold Zone guarding the VIP... er, the Manager."
[HOLD IT!]
[Player]: You were guarding Mr. Billions?
Otto Lock: Affirmative! He was inspecting the assets. I was his shield!
Statement 2: "At 1300 hours (1:00 PM), I took a tactical hydration break."
[HOLD IT!]
[Player]: You left your post?
Otto Lock: Affirmative! Even elite warriors need moisture! I turned my back for exactly ten seconds to engage the water fountain.
Statement 3: "I looked in and saw the hostile (Robbie) standing over the KIA holding the murder weapon!"
[HOLD IT!]
[Player]: You saw him holding the weapon?
Otto Lock: Affirmative! A heavy gold statue! He looked ready to strike again!
Statement 4: "I engaged and apprehended the suspect immediately! Threat neutralized!"
[HOLD IT!]
[Player]: Did he try to run?
Otto Lock: The target cried and asked why the nice man on the floor was sleeping. A pathetic attempt at psychological warfare!

THE FIRST CONTRADICTION
[OBJECTION!] (Player slams desk)
[Player]:
Sgt. Lock! You claim you apprehended Robbie inside the vault at 1300 hours (1:00 PM) standing over the body, correct?
Otto Lock:
Affirmative! My internal clock is synchronized with the atomic network!
[Player]:
You’re lying.
Otto Lock:
!!!
[Player]:
At 1:00 PM exactly, Robbie Banks was using the ATM in the lobby!
[PRESENT: ATM RECEIPT]
Otto Lock: (Salutes nervously)
...Correction?
[Player]:
Unless he can teleport, he couldn't be murdering the manager in the vault and withdrawing $20 at the ATM at the same time. You’re lying about when this happened!
Percy Petty: (Squeaks)
O-Objection! Perhaps the Sergeant's watch was... lagging due to... solar flares?
Otto Lock:
Roger that! My chronometer took a hit during a previous skirmish! I must have apprehended him a few minutes later!
Judge Gavel:
Witness, revise your testimony. This is a murder trial, accuracy is paramount.

TESTIMONY REVISION
Witness Testimony: What I actually saw
"Correction! It was actually 13:10 (1:10 PM) when I spotted the target."
"The target walked right into the vault. He just strolled in like a civilian!"
"He must have struck the victim moments before I entered!"
Percy Petty: (Chuckles)
The Prosecution has evidence to prove the defendant was the killer, regardless of the time.
[Player]: Huh!?
Percy Petty:
[EVIDENCE PRESENTED: GREASE STAINS ON STATUE]
When the Defendant grabbed the heavy gold statue to strike the victim, he left grease on the handle.
[Player]:
Ack!
Judge Gavel:
Grease?
Percy Petty:
Mechanic's grease. The defendant fixes motorcycles as a hobby. His hands were dirty. He grabbed the statue, killed the manager, and left his mark.
Judge Gavel:
The Defense may cross-examine.

THE SECOND CONTRADICTION
Statement 1: "Correction! It was actually 13:10 (1:10 PM) when I spotted the target."
[HOLD IT!]
[Player]: Are you sure this time?
Otto Lock: Affirmative! I cross-referenced with the sun's position!
Statement 2: "The target walked right into the vault. He just strolled in like a civilian!"
[HOLD IT!]
[Player]: He just walked in? Was the door open?
Otto Lock: It must have been! The target bypassed the perimeter with zero resistance!
Statement 3: "He must have struck the victim moments before I entered!"
[HOLD IT!]
[Player]: Did you hear the hit?
Otto Lock: Negative! Silenced impact!
[OBJECTION!] (Player points finger)
[Player]:
Sgt. Lock! You claim Robbie "just walked in" at 1:10 PM?
Otto Lock:
That is the current intel, yes!
[Player]:
[TAKE THAT!] (Presenting Bank Security Manual)
[Player]:
Impossible! According to the Bank's own manual, the vault Auto-Lock engages at 12:55 PM!
Percy Petty:
W-What?!
[Player]:
After 12:55 PM, that door is sealed tight. It cannot be opened without a Key Card! Robbie couldn't have "just strolled in" at 1:10 PM because the door would have been locked! The victim was trapped inside!
Otto Lock: (Sweating, tapping broken radio)
Mayday! Logic shields failing!
[Player]:
The only way Robbie could get in... is if YOU unlocked it for him!
Percy Petty:
Objection! Why would the guard unlock the vault for a murderer? That's absurd!
Otto Lock:
Affirmative! Why would I aid the enemy? Wait... I remember now! There was a maintenance issue!
Judge Gavel:
...A maintenance issue? Witness, this is your last chance. Tell the truth!

TESTIMONY #3: THE "MAINTENANCE" (The Final Lie)
Statement 1: "I didn't unlock it for him! I unlocked it to... inspect the hinges!"
[HOLD IT!]
[Player]:
Inspect the hinges? While a murder was happening?
Otto Lock:
A squeaky hinge is a tactical liability! I had to grease it!
Statement 2: "But I stayed strictly at the entrance! I never fully entered the 'Gold Zone'!"
[HOLD IT!]
[Player]:
You never went inside?
Otto Lock:
Negative! I maintained a defensive position at the doorway to fix the hinges!
Statement 3: "I was busy fixing the door, so I didn't see the body until it was too late!"
[HOLD IT!]
[Player]:
You were "fixing" it? With what tools?
Otto Lock:
Uh... standard issue... tactical wrench? And... lubricants?
[Should I press him on what type of lubricants?]
[Yes] = continue no = give up and go to statement 3
[Player]:
Your Honor! The Defense would like the Witness to add what type of lubricant they used!
Percy Petty:
Objection! Your Honor! There's no relevance!
Judge Gavel:
Does the Defense believe that this is relevant information?
[Yes] = continue no = give up and go to statement 3
Judge Gavel:
Alright then! Witness, add it to your testimony.
Otto Lock:
Sir, yes sir!
(then changes statement 3)
Statement 3 (Revised): "I was busy fixing the door hinges with heavy-duty grease, so I didn't see the body until it was too late!"

THE FINAL BLOW
(Present Murder Weapon)
[OBJECTION!]
[Player]:
Sgt. Lock! You claim you were fixing the door hinges and never went deeper into the vault?
Otto Lock:
Affirmative! I held the perimeter at the doorway! Leaving my post would be desertion!
[Player]:
Then explain why there was grease on the murder weapon.
(Presenting Murder Weapon)
[Player]:
(Percy Petty Objects)
Percy Petty:
So? What does the grease have to do with this?
[Player]
[Desk Slam]
[Player]:
Mr. Petty, you claimed earlier that the grease on the murder weapon belonged to the defendant because he's a mechanic.
Percy Petty:
Correct!
[Player]:
But Sgt. Lock just testified that HE was using heavy-duty grease to fix the hinges!
Otto Lock:
Ack! ...Enemy radar... detected!
[Player]:
If you were only fixing the door hinges at the entrance, how did YOUR grease get on the murder weapon located 30 feet away on the back wall?!
Percy Petty:
(Squeaks) M-Maybe the grease... flew through the air via tactical wind currents?
[Player]:
No! The only way the grease got there is if Otto walked all the way to the back of the vault, picked up the statue, and struck Mr. Billions himself!
Otto Lock: FAILURE! FAILURE! FAILURE!
I... The door... it was fixed! But the Manager... he was going to cut the security budget! It was a tactical elimination!
CLEAN UP ON AISLE... FAILED.

Judge Gavel:
Order! Bailiff, arrest this man for the murder of Mr. Billions!
