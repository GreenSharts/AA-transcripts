Steven's Visual Novel Engine by Steven_Scripts


- INTRODUCTION -
Hi, and thanks for checking out my visual novel engine!
This is my first attempt at making any kind of engine, so my apologies if it's a
little rough around the edges.

This engine comes with a variety of features, such as:
- Basic saving and loading system
- Automatic theme customization
- Full RichText support for bold, italics, etc.
- Backgrounds, covers, sprites and title cards
- Simple, intuitive sound playing system for SFX and BGM

To learn how to set up and use SVNE, take a look at the scripts underneath this
README script. I recommend starting with "1 - Getting Started".

Have a bug report or a question? Don't be afraid to contact me through one of
my socials!
