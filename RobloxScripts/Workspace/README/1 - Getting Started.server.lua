- BASIC SETUP -
1. For each model under "Steven's Visual Novel Engine", place it into the service
specified, then press Ctrl+U with the model selected to ungroup it.
2. If your game isn't published, publish it now using Alt+P.
3. In the Home tab under the Roblox Studio topbar, click Game Settings.
4. Click Security.
5. Toggle "Enable Studio Access to API Services". This allows you to test save
data in Roblox Studio.
6. You're done! You may keep this folder for reference or delete it entirely.


- PLAYING THE DEMO -
To confirm that you have set up the engine correctly, verify that everything is
functional, and understand what SVNE is capable of, I highly recommend playing
through the premade demo provided in this free model.

Once you've completed basic setup, you can test the demo simply by playtesting
the game. The demo comes with two chapters and provides a general overview of
the features SVNE comes with.

Next, take a look at lesson 2: Making Your First Story to learn how to use SVNE.


- UPDATING THE ENGINE -
If a new version of SVNE comes out and you would like to update to the newest
version, follow these instructions:
1. Delete all SVNE scripts and folders, excluding any new objects you created.
2. Import the SVNE free model and follow the setup instructions.
3. Done!

Do note that if you directly modify the SVNE scripts or vnGui, your changes will
be wiped every time you update.
